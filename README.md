## Hi there :wave: I'm Arjun Subramanian. Welcome to my GitHub :innocent:!
* :telescope: I’m spending my time learning many new skills (see below) and practicing competitive programming. In addition, I've been participating in hackathons which have been a lot of fun :blush:! I love the experience of working with a team to develop some final product.
* :seedling: I’m currently learning full stack development and machine learning. Both these topics are super interesting and frankly out of my comfort zone. (Most of my coding experience is in competitive programming). I hope to apply these skills in hackathons and my own personal projects.
* :dancers: I’m looking to collaborate on hackathons, start-ups (including tutoring), and any projects that could use my skill set or algorithmic problem solving :brain:.
* :mortar_board: Accomplishments: I'm in the USACO Gold division and currectly an "Expert" in [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/arjunsubramanian). Additionally, I tutor students in [python](https://github.com/asubramanian08/PythonClass) and [c++](https://github.com/asubramanian08/StormingRobots), and I have created a few winning [hackathon projects](https://devpost.com/asubramanian135). See my [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uI0RXTPqTmsUZgOpBQsL_A4PPwwto4EsdytBQhftL3w/edit?usp=sharing) to see more of my skills and achievements :smile:.

* :zap: Fun fact: I enjoy to ski :ski: and roller skate in my free time.
